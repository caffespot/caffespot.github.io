Hi @andy5995, @DoNotSpamPls, and @tagatuha,

 

Edit: You need to use our new IP addresses to set up custom domains. These are:

- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153


If you are still having this problem  after using these new IP addresses and haven't opened up a ticket with our support team, could you please contact us at git.io/c? That way, we can help resolve this issue.

 

Thanks!
